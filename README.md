# CelebA_Interface

This repository contains the code to run an interface for more easily labeling images in the CelebA dataset. You can select the appropriate emotions (12 in total), go to the next image using the "NEXT" button, and save the changes into a CSV file anytime during labeling using the "SAVE" button. It is recommended that the file be opened in Jupyter Notebook.
